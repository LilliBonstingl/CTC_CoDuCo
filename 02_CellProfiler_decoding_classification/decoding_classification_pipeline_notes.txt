[   1] [Images]
  To begin creating your project, use the Images module to compile a list of files and/or folders that you want to analyze. You can also specify a set of rules to include only the desired files in your selected folders.
  
  ! ADD these images:
  - ROI full res original scan
  - ROI full res BG scan (if available)
  - ROI mask binary images

[   2] [Metadata]
  The Metadata module optionally allows you to extract information describing your images (i.e, metadata) which will be stored along with your measurements. This information can be contained in the file name and/or location, or in an external file.

[   3] [NamesAndTypes]
  The NamesAndTypes module allows you to assign a meaningful name to each image by which other modules will refer to it.
  
  ! IF no BG scan is available: change rule criteria to "file does not contain BG" for ALL images

[   4] [Groups]
  The Groups module optionally allows you to split your list of images into image subsets (groups) which will be processed independently of each other. Examples of groupings include screening batches, microtiter plates, time-lapse movies, etc.

  Background subtraction: 
  There is often high autofluorescence which impairs in situ signal detection.
  To improve the signal to background ratio, in situ signals are stripped from the sample, the background (BG) image is scanned and aligned and finally subtracted from the original scan.
  
  ADJUST multiplication factor for each sample: in the test mode,  hover the mouse over several autofluorescent areas in the cytoplasm to check intensity values - after BG subtraction, the intensity should be close to 0 without losing in situ signals.
  
  ! IF no BG scan is available, set multiplication factor of second (=BG) image to 0.

[  11] [Resize]
  ROIs were identified in the 8x8 binned DAPI image.
  A binary image of each ROI was saved as ROI_mask_image.
  The bounding box values of each ROI were multiplied by 8 to scale them to the full resolution image and ROIs were cropped from the full resolution image.
  
  This module resizes the ROI_mask_image (multiply by 8) to scale it to the full resolution image.

  The ROI_mask_image was resized (multiplied by 8) to scale it to the full resolution image.
  This module uses the ROI_mask_resized_image to mask the Nucleus_raw_image.

  ADJUST lower and upper bounds on threshold (and if necessary the threshold correction factor), to get the best results for identification and declumping of nuclei! In the test mode, you can hover the mouse over the nuclei to get an idea about pixel intensity values (always between 0-1).

  Cell borders are identified by enlarging the nuclei by a specified number of pixels.
  Most CTCs have larger nuclei and Cytoplasm than PBMCs. If cell borders for small and large nuclei were drawn the same size, in situ signals of neighboring CTCs (or false positive in situ signals from unspecific background/artefacts) would be wrongfully assigned to PBMCs.
  
  In this module, we split the nucleus objects into two object sets based on their area.
  
  Note: in 3 control samples 233LB, 235LB, 237LB (no tumor cells), 95% of detected cells had a nucleus area >2800 pixels.

  Therefore, we split the nucleus objects into two object sets based on their area before identifying the cell borders.
  
  This module combines small and large cells (cell border objects) into one object set.
  
  "Segment" will combine both object sets and attempt to re-draw segmentation to separate objects which overlapped. Because the Cell border is larger for large nuclei, the segmentation is also re-drawn in favor of the large cells. This way, the in situ signals of neighboring CTCs are less likely to be assigned to PBMCs
